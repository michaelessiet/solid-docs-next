<Title>onCleanup</Title>

This is a lifecycle function that is run in the browser, this registers a cleanup function that executes on disposal or recalculation of the current reactive scope. This can be used in any Component and effect.

## Typescript Function Signature

```tsx
function onCleanup(fn: () => void): void;
```

## Example

```tsx
import {createSignal, Show, onCleanup} from 'solid-js'

function MyComponent() {
  onCleanup(() => {
    console.log('MyComponent got cleaned up')
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This is a component that has cleanup function</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

function ParentComponent() {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = createSignal(true)

  return (
    <>
      <button>Toggle visibility</button>
      <Show when={isVisible} fallback={<p>MyComponent has been cleaned up</p>}>
        <MyComponent/>
      </Show>
    </>
  )
}
```

In the example above whenever `MyComponent` is removed from the DOM the `onCleanup` function will run which will in turn cause "MyComponent got cleaned up" to be logged out.
