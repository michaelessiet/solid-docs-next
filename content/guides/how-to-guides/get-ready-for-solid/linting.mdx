<Title>Linting</Title>

## Setting Up a Linter 
Solid has a strong community of developers and some of those developers create tools that make the development experience that much better for other developers in the community. The eslint plugin we'll be making use of is just one of those tools made by one of our community members.

<Aside>
  Eslint is tool that statically analyzes Javascript and Typescript code for problems and suggest quick fixes if any to the developer. For more on the eslint tool visit <Link href="https://eslint.org/" target="_blank">here</Link>.

Now let's get down to adding the linter to our Solid project.

#### Javascript
**Step 1:** Install `eslint`, and `eslint-plugin-solid` the plugin made by our community member

```bash
> npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-solid
# or
> yarn add --dev eslint eslint-plugin-solid
```

**Step 2:** Initialize `eslint` within your projects main folder
```bash
> npm init @eslint/config
```
Once you run this command you will be prompted to answer a few questions about your project. Make sure you answer them accordingly. When you're asked `"Does your project use TypeScript"` answer `"no"`, `"what framework does your project use"` answer `"none"`, and `"Where does your code run"` answer `"browser"` since Solid is a frontend framework.

**Step 3:** Configure the generated `eslint` file to work on Solid code. Add the below code to the appropriate fields in your `.eslint` file
```js
{
  ...
  "plugins": ["solid"],
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:solid/recommended"]
  ...
}
```

And that's it. Eslint should be setup and working for Solid.

#### Typescript
**Step 1:** Install `eslint`, and `eslint-plugin-solid` the plugin made by our community member

```bash
> npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-solid
# or
> yarn add --dev eslint eslint-plugin-solid
```

**Step 2:** Initialize `eslint` within your projects main folder
```bash
> npm init @eslint/config
```
Once you run this command you will be prompted to answer a few questions about your project. Make sure you answer them accordingly. When you're asked `"Does your project use TypeScript"` answer `"yes"`, `"what framework does your project use"` answer `"none"`, and `"Where does your code run"` answer `"browser"` since Solid is a frontend framework.

Then, you should be asked to install some Typescript specific packages called `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@latest` and `@typescript-eslint/parser@latest` answer `"yes"` to this.

**Step 3:** Configure the generated `eslint` file to work on Solid code. Add the below code to the appropriate fields in your `.eslint` file
```js
{
  ...
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser", // if not already added
  "plugins": ["solid"],
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:solid/typescript"]
  ...
}
```

And that's it. Eslint should be setup for Typescript and Solid.
