<Title> Deploying To Firebase </Title>

Here we're going to use [Firebase's hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting) service to host our Solid project.

If you haven't heard of Firebase, it's an app development platform run by Google. For more information on Firebase and the services it offers make sure to visit their [website](https://firebase.google.com/).

Before proceeding make sure that you have created a project in your Firebase console which you will use to host your Solid project. For guidance on how to do this follow the first step of [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#create-firebase-project-and-app).

## Using The Firebase CLI Tool

**Step 1:** Make sure you have [`firebase-tools`](https://www.npmjs.com/packages/firebase-tools) properly installed

```bash
npm i -g firebase-tools
# or
pnpm i -g firebase-tools
# or
yarn global add firebase-tools
```

**Step 2:** Run the `firebase login` command, and make sure that you are logged into your Firebase account where you created the Firebase project that you will be using to host your Solid project.

**Step 3:** In your Solid project root directory, add two files namely `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc`.

In `firebase.json` copy the following code:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": []
  }
}
```

And in `.firebaserc` copy the following code:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "<YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID>"
  }
}
```

**Step 4:** Run `npm run build` then run `firebase deploy`. Once the deploy command is done running you should see a message like this on your command line

The `Hosting URL` is the live deployment of your project. Feel free to visit it and see your work in action.
